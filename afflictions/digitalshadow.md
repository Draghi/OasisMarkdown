# Digital Shadows

For a long time it was officially denied, but, it turns out the neural lace system is not entirely safe. If a person dies whilst interacting with neurally linked technology, particularly full-dive VR, a digital impression of them can be left in the device - similar to how nanites reconstruct the body, digital systems attempt to stabalize "hole" left by someone plugged into it who's mind suddenly vanishes.

Unlike echos, these shadows are much more human-like as their actions as AIs step in to determine how the shadow *would* act, based on previous observational data. Shadows can cause major issues with conntected systems, such as wreaking havoc on traffic systems, destroying systems or interfering with other users of the system. A particularly spot-lighted case involves a violent communist, that self-describes as a "freedom fighter", who died at the hands of VirtuTech goons whilst in the middle of hacking into their servers. The shadow he left behind continued with the hacking attempt and managed to get access to the files regarding shadows and disseminate them into the public.

These days Digital Shadows are particularly rare, as systems have been patched to prevent the behaviour, reduce its likelyhood or, at the very least, notify someone in the case that the system notices the creation of a shadow within itself.

Digital shadows are functionally immortal and can hide pieces of themselves within data files, backups and similar. Typically, the only way to deal with them is to completely wipe every microchip clean and then reflash them with a fresh and known-safe installation.
