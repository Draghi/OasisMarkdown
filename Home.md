## Cybernetics-Induced Hypohemia

Cybernetic Induced Hypohemia (CIH) is an increasingly common techno-disease seen in individuals with extensive cybernetic modifications. The exact cause is unknown, but, once a critical mass of the body is replaced with chrome an irreversible change in the body occurs, reducing the production rate of blood below sustrainable levels. Suffers grow pale, and weaker, day-by-day until they eventually succum to the illness. Currently there is no cure, but regular blood transfusions are able to completely reverse progression of the disease - short of any necrosis in particularly long-running cases. 

Unfortunately, blood supplies were quickly over-burdened in the first wave of cases. In response, synthetic blood was developed and supplied by the medicare system. Synthetic blood is the bare minimium to stave off death from the disease, long-term dependants develop severe paranoid insomnia, as a result pharmaceutical-powerhouse "Medicorp" developed PremiumBlood™. This proprietary formula uses a mixture of human blood, synthetic blood and a variety of other drugs to significantly reduce the drawbacks of Synthetic Blood and improve quality-of-life back to something that could be considered "normal". However, it's been claimed by some, now discredited, medical researchers that this formulation appears to be designed to additionally have an addictive element - Medicorp firmly denies the allegation and any private researchers that have looked into it have refuted the claim.

Medicorp sources its blood from "volunteers" that they compensate for their "donation", the blood is carefully filtered before being used and as such particularly destitude, ill or heavy-drug users are frequent participants. Medicorp also produces its own synthetic blood, that it also sells to the state for use in the medicare system. Access to PremiumBlood™ requires private medical cover in order to be given the ability to **purchase** at an additional cost, requiring additional purchase and maintance of a transfusion machine. Certain communist terror groups have made strong threats directed at Medicorp for, apparently, exploiting terribly vulnerable people.

Whilst the poor are stuck on Synthetic Blood and the "middle" class paying out the nose for PremiumBlood™, the upperclass tend to be the recipients of pure blood transfusions for the obvious reasons - some even pay for live, person to person, transfusions. Additionally there is another group who get their hands on pure blood, criminals. Certain organizations have developed some back-alley cybernetics that replace the lower jaw with a "live" transfusion system - allowing those outfitted to 'drink' blood directly from people, whilst also terrifying them.

In popular culture, suffers are typically called "Cybernetic Vampires", "CyVamps" or just "Vampires" for a few reasons. First being the obvious one of requiring other peoples blood; Second, their paleness, paranoia and insomnia forcing them to be awake frequently at night; Third, their extensive cybernetic modifications make them appear superhuman - like the vampires of old; and lastly, that blood-drinking modification really didn't help optics. These terms are frequently slurs, but, certain sub-groups of suffers embrace the term to varying degrees and typically people have no ill-intent in using them.

## Echo

An Echo is a corpse that has been reanimated by nanites. Typically this occurs after the death of a heavily modified individual where the nanites fail to register the host's death. They go into emergency mode and attempt to restart the body, using themselves and parts of the body as material to maintain the body's function. Most Echos will simply sway in the wind until the nanites have consumed the majority of the body.

Despire their ability to keep the body's tissue alive after death, they are unable to restart the brain except for brief moments. During these moments the nanites might attempt to intepret their hosts "thoughts", typically resulting in a "Beserker". Beserkers consume metal and flesh to provide the nanites with new material and will attack bystanders unprovoked or, less commonly, flee. It's believed that the nanites are responding to the pain and fear of death their owner felt prior to death.

Very rarely, more advanced behaviours are exhibited. These types of echos do not have official classifications, but onlookers typically refer to them with the name of the popular-culture undead, Zombies. As an example, one such Echo put together a bouquet and placed it next to their spose's sleeping body, before heading to the park and drawing its final breath. Another begged for their life so earnestly with the cleanup-team, that they called in an ambulance - which was able to confirm that the person was indeed an echo.

## Chimera

Chimeras are atypically biologically modified individuals who graft organs and DNA of other animals into themselves. The science is technically there, with the assistance of nanites, but the modifications are typically less effective than tranditional solutions and more expensive. Certain people see them as more a more "natural" or "safe" way to keep up with the abilities of other modified individuals, others claim to feel close spiritiual feelings towards certain animals and undertake these modifications to deepen their undertstanding and relationship and others just really want cat ears or a tail.

Side effects of chimeric modifications include the development of animal-like behaviours, autoimmune issues and, in heavily augmented individuals, psychosis resulting in a temporary state where they are entirely animal-like - which is particularly problematic for people who're splicing gorillas, lions or other predators into themselves.
